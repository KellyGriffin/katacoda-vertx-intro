In this scenario, you will learn how OpenShift can build Docker Images based on a Git repository. The OpenShift Docker Registry stores the build images before being deployed. This process is known as Source-to-Image (s2i).

OpenShift is a platform for managing your infrastructure, helping you go from source code to scaling and securing production. The build functionality represents a vital part of the journey, allowing a consistent and centralised approach to the application lifecycle.
