In this scenario, you will learn how to use stateful containers and have the data stored on a shared Network File System (NFS). Being able to persist data makes it possible to run processes such as databases, caching servers or object stores within containers.

Being utilising an NFS with OpenShift, it is possible to manage persistence alongside containers and ensure containers have access to the data as they scale on multiple hosts.
